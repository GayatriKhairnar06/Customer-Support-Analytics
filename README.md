# Customer Support Analytics â€“ CSAT Prediction & Service Optimization

# Objective
The goal of this project is to improve customer service efficiency and predict satisfaction outcomes (CSAT)using structured support ticket data.
Through a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA), NLP, and basic machine learning models, we identify patterns and build a deployable satisfaction predictor.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset includes historical support case records 

Project Workflow

# 1. ðŸ“Š EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Performed **UBM analysis**:
  - **Univariate**: Frequency of CSAT scores, sub-categories, agent shifts
  - **Bivariate**: CSAT vs shift, CSAT vs response time, CSAT vs tenure
  - **Multivariate**: Heatmap of CSAT by shift and tenure bucket
# 2. ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates, handled missing values
- Converted date columns, created new `response_time_min` field
- Encoded categorical features for modeling
# 3. ðŸ§  ML Modeling
- **Logistic Regression** for linear trend modeling
- **Random Forest Classifier** for improved accuracy
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report
- **Feature Importance** plotted for interpretability
# 4. âœ¨ NLP Insights
- Generated a **Word Cloud** from open customer remarks
- Applied **sentiment analysis** using `TextBlob`
- Visualized **sentiment polarity** distribution
#  Key Insights
- Longer response times result in lower CSAT
- Specific complaint categories (e.g., Exchange, Return) have lower satisfaction
- Afternoon shifts perform better overall
- Negative sentiment in remarks often correlates with low CSAT
# Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy** â€“ Data processing
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** â€“ Visualization
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ Machine Learning
- **TextBlob**, **WordCloud** â€“ NLP
- **Jupyter Notebook** / **Colab** â€“ Development platform
# Future Enhancements
- Deploy as a live dashboard with Streamlit or Flask
- Integrate more advanced ML/NLP techniques
- Build a feedback alert system based on sentiment scores
